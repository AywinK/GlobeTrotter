## User Story

```
As a travel enthusiast, I want convenient access to resources that simplify my journey, so that I can have a stress-free holiday experience and be well prepared for any disruptions.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a travel-oriented web application

WHEN the page loads
THEN I am presented with the following with a polished and responsive UI:
An inspiring banner that gives me confidence in the app
The ability to search for a city
Information about the city I recently searched and the ability to clear searched city
Get some popular travel ideas
The ability to navigate easily between pages

WHEN I search for a city
THEN the city is saved and I am presented with the following information:
City name and country
Current weather
Current time and date
Local emergency services number
News relating to the city

WHEN I navigate to the translation page
THEN I am presented with a form that will allow me to submit  text in a foreign language and receive the english translation and what language the original text is in. The recent translation details also have to persist between page loads.

WHEN I navigate to the currency convertor page
THEN I am presented with a form that will allow me to submit the amount and currencies to convert, and receive the converted amount and the conversion rate. This data along with the date of the information has to be stored on my device and persist between page loads for recent queries.

WHEN I try to access a page that does not exist
THEN I am informed that the page does not exist, but also feel more connected with the applicationâ€™s branding.
